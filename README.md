# Instructions for executing program 1
1. Open terminal and move to directory "progs/prog_1"
2. Make sure Python 3.11.4 or later is installed
3. Execute the command "py weather.py" (Make sure Python is in your PATH env variable, else replace "py" with the exe path)
This program simply takes user input and prints to the console weather details of the given geographical location.
